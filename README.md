Robotics with the Boe-Bot PARALLAX INC.

The code for the Boe-Bot that we're working on right now !!!


CenterServoP12.bs2 and CenterServoP13.bs2 are used to center servos. 

StripeFollowingBoeBot.bs2 is for what we've previously done in class.

IntersectionsBoeBot.bs2 is the code at the very end of the book; we're probably not going to even use it

IRandGripper.bs2 is for what we're doing in class now.

PiezoMusic.bs2 is just for fun.
